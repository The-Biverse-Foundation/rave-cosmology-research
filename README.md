# Rave Cosmology Research
## Presented by: The Biverse Foundation
A repository for apps related to Rave Cosmology including the study of fixed stars, Global Cycles, statistical analysis of the Rave Mandala and other research projects related to Human Design.

## Apps:
### Fixed Star Explorer
The Fixed Star Explorer app allows you to browse The 66 Sides, 66 significant fixed stars studied in Rave Cosmology. It contains approximate positions of the stars as of February 15, 2025. You are then able to calculate, using the rate of the precession of the equinoxes, where those stars were throughout history. You can use a date picker to explore dates and it automatically adjusts the fixed star position and displays it in G2B (Gate-to-Base) Notation showing the Gate, Line, Color, Tone, and Base where that star was at that point in history. You can also set future dates to see where the stars will be.

#### Editor's Note: If anyone wants to update the fixed stars to a more accurate position, please do. These are positions based on calculated adjustments from the values Ra gave in a Rave Cosmology lecture, so it would be nice to double check all 66 positions. If anyone wants to take on this task, simply download the project and edit the config/fixed_stars.yml file, and you can use astro.com's Fixed Star feature to see where that star was as of February 15, 2027. The current fixed stars have positions with a reference date of February 15, 2025 because they were calculated for the High Desert Human Design Winter event. But, if we are going to recalculate the positions, we should also change the reference date to February 15, 2027, as that is a more significant date for obvious reasons, as it is the changing of the keys and entering into a new Global Cycle. â€”Jonah
