## Yin/Yin Base and Gender Identity â€” Ra Uru Hu (Living Design, October 2002)

> Think about the men who are carrying this, because it speaks a lot about what happens to them at the surface of their lives. It has a deep impact on them because this is a very, very yin base. So you have people who have sexual gender crises because of the nature of this base.
>
> In other words, that this yin/yin base, when it's going to be something that is carried by a male, isn't necessarily going to be something that they might find easy to carry. You cannot really identify with that, really know why that is there inside of you.
>
> Obviously, we are going to have a lot of men carry this yin/yin base and the confusion that comes with all of that. In the same way the female who is going to be 1st base is going to have difficulty with the deeper aspects of her feminine or yin nature because there is all this yang at work that is going to be the facet focus.
>
> If somebody is a 3rd base, they are probably in female bodies 80 or 90 percent of their incarnations. Every once in a while they have to have a taste of being thrown into a vehicle that is different.

## AstroDatabank Sample Analysis (n = 5516)

**Total Males:** 4123  
**Total Females:** 1393

### Base 1

| Gender | Actual | Expected | Difference |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| Male   | 842    | 824      | +18        |
| Female | 272    | 278      | -6         |

### Base 3

| Gender | Actual | Expected | Difference |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| Male   | 796    | 824      | -28        |
| Female | 279    | 278      | +1         |

> **ChatGPT Analysis**:  
> From this data, it seems there is no significant effect of base on gender distribution. The numbers fall within a reasonable range of what's expected from a uniform distribution across the 5 bases. This suggests that the base distribution is fairly gender-neutral in your dataset for these specific bases, with no pronounced skew towards one gender over the other.

## AA-Rated Sample

### Base 1

| Gender | Actual | Expected | Difference |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| Male   | 603    | 574      | +29        |
| Female | 146    | 144      | +2         |

### Base 3

| Gender | Actual | Expected | Difference |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|
| Male   | 566    | 574      | -8         |
| Female | 127    | 144      | -17        |

> **ChatGPT Analysis**:  
> The chi-squared test results show:  
> - Chi-squared statistic: **0.248**  
> - Degrees of freedom: **1**  
> - p-value: **0.619**  
> Since the p-value is much greater than 0.05, this means there is no statistically significant difference between genders for Base 1 and Base 3 distributions. In other words, Base appears to be gender-neutral in this AA-rated sample set.

## Python Script for Verification

```python
# Data for each base
base_data = {
    1: {"male": 842, "female": 272},
    2: {"male": 807, "female": 285},
    3: {"male": 796, "female": 279},
    4: {"male": 839, "female": 286},
    5: {"male": 839, "female": 271}
}

# Total males and females
total_males = 4123
total_females = 1393

# Expected counts per base
expected_male = total_males / 5
expected_female = total_females / 5

# Calculate differences for each base
base_differences = {}

for base, data in base_data.items():
    male_diff = data["male"] - expected_male
    female_diff = data["female"] - expected_female
    base_differences[base] = {
        "male_actual": data["male"],
        "female_actual": data["female"],
        "male_diff": male_diff,
        "female_diff": female_diff
    }
